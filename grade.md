## Comments
Fantastic work! Just some minor picky comments.

### HTML
Search for `prof comment` in individual files for specific comments.

- You are adding some extra `<div>` elements in places where they are unnecessary. Only add `<div>` elements when the existing semantic/descriptive html structure cannot create the desired layout. The goal is to add as few `<div>` elements as possible.

### CSS
Search for `prof comment` in individual files for specific comments.

The blog content is an example of where its better to use descendent selectors over classes. You put a class on every single heading and `p` tag, which was a lot of work. Instead you could have applied those styles without needing the classes with a selector like `.article p`. This is both simpler, and safer, because it protects you if you forget to add a class somewhere.

### Responsive Design
